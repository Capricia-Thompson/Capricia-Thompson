### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Starting with the prompts...

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on gaining knowledge of various coding languages, libraries, frameworks, databases, etc to enhance my versatility as a software engineer and determine which set best agrees with me and my projects.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python, Javascript, and C# for web development. However, I'm looking forward to moving into AI, Machine Learning, and Quality Assurance.

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything you want to know.

- ðŸ“« How to reach me: currently Linkedin, but my portfolio website is soon to come.

- âš¡ Fun fact: I have a lot of pets...a lot of them.

- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with getting a job in software engineering. Let me know if you're hiring or know someone who is.
